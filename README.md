# Empty-Project
Standard Calahanlab empty project

Standard projects do not normally track items in the directories "Drafts", "References", "Research", or "Visual Elements". The expectation is that the items here are not usually edited per se, and as essentially static items are stored on a wide area network. The lines for these in .gitignore should be uncommented after cloning the repository. They are commented at first in order to make sure that cloning generates the directories.

Eventually there will be Calahanlab packages functions to handle these static files on various cloud storages such as Google Drive.
