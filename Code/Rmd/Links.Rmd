Investigating the Cost- Effectiveness of Nutrient Credit Use As an Option for VDOT Stormwater Permitting Requirements

{Nobles et al., 2014, #89488}

August 2014

Assess potential credit demand, focusing on James River, compare costs WQT v. BMPs.

WQT: Water Quality Trading.
BMP: not exactly our BMPs? “Structural BMPs are physical structures that are constructed onsite to mitigate the impacts of stormwater runoff.”

I propose a new metric: Lost Credits for the Past N years.

The goal here is to see how an ATS complex could be built that would trade in a WQT program.

“Now, in addition to trading between point sources (PS-PS) or between point and nonpoint sources (PS-NPS), it is possible to trade between nonpoint sources (NPS-NPS)”

Can we sell it to the VDOT. What is the possible credit demand, and how much ATS acreage is that?

Their refs 8-14. Esp 12, a list of active programs that we might be able to flog.

Credit users have been investing in their own remediation rather than purchasing others’, N and P the most used.

Replicate their methods - we would need their database. Their equation 1 as derived in (18).

What is linear development - pipelines, powerlines, etc?

What is ROW? Right of way?

Pre-construction cost: design, permitting, and contingency costs.

1-lb P credits: 10,430 (James), 18,700 (Potomac). 17K - 20K (York); 14.7K - 16.45K (Rappahannock). What is the clearinghouse that generates the credits?

Compare their costs with ATS costs for the same removal. Tables 2 & 3.
